WEEK 1 challenge - Aidan Brennan-Law

Description
This project was asigned to me the first week of the UofM coding bootcamp. The challenge was to clean up the original code and use semantic HTML elements to keep the code organized and clean. Organization was only part of it though. I also used positioning to change the look of the navigation links.
